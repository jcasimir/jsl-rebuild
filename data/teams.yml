  description: "A college teaching assistant told me once that I was a great software developer and a terrible computer scientist. That meant the software I wrote cared more for the user experience then the size of it’s Big O Notation. My professional experience comes from a testing background where I sought to automate myself out of a job. Bringing me in to software development where I became the resident generalist who was always willing to step up to learn technologies. By far it has been my empathy which has helped me the most in being able to communicate and teach to peers and students."
